          <h2 class="about-section-title">My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into web development didnâ€™t start in a classroom â€” it
            began with curiosity. I was fascinated by how websites functioned
            behind the scenes, and that simple interest sparked countless hours
            of self-learning, experimentation, and building. What started as a
            hobbyâ€”tinkering with HTML and customizing layoutsâ€”soon became a
            passion for solving real-world problems with code. As I explored
            deeper, I found myself drawn to the balance of logic and creativity
            that web development offers. From building my first static webpage
            to creating full-stack applications with Node.js, Express, and
            MongoDB, every step has been a learning experience. Today, I
            approach each project with that same sense of curiosity and
            commitment to constant growth.
          </p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2 class="about-section-title">My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and always look for
            opportunities to learn new tools, frameworks, and best practices. I
            believe great websites arenâ€™t just functional â€” they are rooted in a
            strong understanding of user experience, accessibility, and
            thoughtful design. I prioritize performance and scalability,
            ensuring my solutions are not just effective today but adaptable for
            tomorrow. For me, development is not just about code â€” it's about
            creating meaningful experiences that connect with people.

          <h2 class="about-section-title">Work Style</h2>
          <p>
            I approach web development with a blend of creativity, structure,
            and user-focused thinking. I enjoy transforming ideas into
            interactive, responsive interfaces while keeping performance and
            accessibility in mind. Whether working independently or as part of a
            team, I value clean code, clear communication, and continuous
            improvement. My workflow is driven by curiosity, problem-solving,
            and a strong commitment to delivering thoughtful, efficient web
            experiences.
